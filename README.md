# Event ICS Generator

This Python script generates an ICS (iCalendar) file for an event based on user input. The generated ICS file can be imported into various calendar applications such as Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-ics-generator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd event-ics-generator
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. Follow the prompts to enter the event details such as subject, location, description, start time, and end time.

6. The script will generate an ICS file in the same directory as the script, named based on the event subject.
